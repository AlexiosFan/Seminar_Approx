# Seminar_Approx
This is the repository for the TUM master's seminar on Selected Topics in Efficient Algorithms. The topic of this seminar paper is the local and greedy search of approximation algorithms.

## Algorithms covered
The planned list of algorithms to be included in this work is (but not limited to)
- Job Scheduling on Single Machine
- Job Scheduling on k-parallel machinees
- K-center clustering
- Traveling Salesman
- Maximizing float in bank accounts
- Edge Coloring

## Structure of Presentation(subject to change)
1. Intro to Approximation, to be absorbed if the other candidate comes in the first place
2. Discriminination of local/greedy search
3. Actual contents
4. Conclusion with some overview of related courses?

## Questions to ask
1. Is an abstract necessary for an rewriting of a textbook instead of a paper?
2. Are pseudocodes necessary given that the ideas of approximation are usually fairly simple?
3. There is probably no space for everything inside the paper: difference in contents between presentation and paper?
4. grading scheme: which one is more important, the paper or the presentation?
